# Project II
This project is based on an assignment for a course in **'Discrete Mathematics'** 
given at *KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm*.

Instead of Mathematica, the **Pluto Notebook** was used to create 
an interactive notebook.
All code is written in **Julia**, however, som interacting parts had 
some **JavaScrips** and **CSS** in them.
